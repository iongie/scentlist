In the case of alpha-Ionone, about 85% purity can be achieved on an industrial scale."

The last step is dehydration to obtain Ambroxan® (laevorotatory), the final product. Sclareolide in its racemic form can also be obtained by a purely synthetic route. Therefore, its laevorotatory isomer must be separated before the synthesis of Ambroxan®.\n\nNowaday, there is a better process to obtain Ambrofix. This molecule can be obtained throught a unique multi-step bioconversion process starting from sugar cane. \nThis new process is considered as the most sustainable process for Ambrofix in the market.All carbon atoms of the bio-based starting material are ending up in the product – no Carbon wasted leading to optimal carbon efficiency. Also, it needs 100x less land use to produce 1 kg of the Ambrofix compared to the traditional route based on Clary Sage\nThis new bioconversion route maintains the classification as 100% Naturally Derived.

This frist step leads to an ester, esterified using methanol (catalysor : paratoluensulfonic acid). Putting the ester in contact with pure sodium leads to a Bouveau-Blanc rearrangement, cycling the intermediary product into two acetates, linked by a positional isomery. To remove the ester groups from these two molecules, a reductive deacetoxylation is carried out with ammonia and calcium. This way, both Cosmone® isomers are obtained, to be separated by distillation."

The rotatory power of the two molecules is opposite, which explains why the racemic mixture of the two compounds is optically stable.Myrcene,Ocimene, Pinene and Terpinene are constitutional isomers of D-Limonene. All these isomers also belong to the family of molecules called terpenes, although they do not share the same smell.

A hydration of ethylene consists in mixing it with water under a high pressure, in the presence of an acidic catalyst such as phosphoric acid, to shift the reaction equilibrium to obtain ethanol. The final reaction product contains 10 to 25% ethanol. This is the process used in perfumery. Fermentation of sugars (from sugar beet or sugar cane, for example) in the presence of yeasts such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are generally used for the preparation of alcoholic beverages."

A radical addition of allyl alcohol to this starting reagent, in the presence of a peroxide, allows to implant an alcohol function linked to a carbon chain on the starting molecule. An acidic catalysis enables a dehydration of the intermediate product. Then, an addition of hydrogen peroxide in an acid medium to the molecule obtained in the previous process, followed by a heating of the last intermediate in xylene, allows the synthesis of Exaltolide®. The second synthesis route is made from polyesters of 15-hydroxypentadecanoic acid (which is prepared by a rather complex first process), placed under a high vacuum and in the presence of a trans-esterification catalyst."

The reaction of these intermediates with sodium acetate, followed by a saponification of the esters obtained, enables to obtain pure synthetic Geraniol, after a fractional distillation. Finally,Linaloolcan be subjected to a catalysis containing orthovanadates, to obtain Geraniol andNerol, separable by fractional distillation. The majority of synthetic Geraniol produced today remain synthesized fromalpha-Pinene, which givesLinalool, converted to linalyl borates and rearranged into geranyl and neryl borates, in the presence of a vanadate catalysis.

Nevertheless, this Hedione® tends to be more unstable than the classic Hedione®, as it isomerizes in its trans form, more stable.

This method offers a high purity and a very good yield. FromMyrcene, a reaction with a dialkylamine allows to synthesize 7-hydroxygeranyl dialkylamine, after an acid hydrolysis. After that, the presence of palladium (II) phosphine in a catalytic amount allows to change the place of the double bond in order to obtain a compound called enamine. A last acid hydrolysis of this compound allows to obtain Hydroxycitronellal."

Today, many synthetic routes are being developed to make this synthesis greener. These methods are always esterification reactions, but they use a cleaner biocatalysis, multiple reactors including enzymes and dehydrating substances, to shift the equilibrium of the reaction and obtain a purer MIP, while recycling the remaining reagents."

The resultingD-Limonenenitrosochloride is subjected to a treatment with a weak base, removing hydrochloric acid. Finally, an acid hydrolysis in the presence of acetone allows to obtain the final product. Another method synthesizes L-Carvone from the sameD-Limonene, transforming it into its 1,2-epoxide, resulting in a regioselective rearrangement, making it possible to obtain L-Carveol. The catalysis of this first step is metallic and phenolic. An Oppenhauer oxidation allows to obtain the final L-Carvone.

The first one is the result of dextrorotatoryCitronellalcyclization (obtained naturally or fromMyrcene), by reaction with a Lewis acid such as zinc chloride. The product obtained is a mixture ofIsopulegolisomers (the laevorotatory isomer being obtained in majority). Then, the isomers ofIsopulegolcan be separated to recover the laevorotatory component and synthesize L-Menthol by a catalytic hydrogenation. This hydrogenation can also take place before the separation of the L-Menthol (which then, would have to be esterified). A second route of synthesis starts from laevorotatory piperitone which is hydrogenated in the presence of a Raney nickel catalyst. A mixture of L-Menthol isomers is obtained. The isomers are separated by saponification and crystallization, through an esterification reaction of the L-Menthol. A third process starts from the dextrorotatoryDelta-3-Carene, present inTurpentine EO. It is isomerized into dextrorotatory 2-Carene and pyrolyzed to trans-2,8-p-Menthadiene. Isomerizing the latter synthesizes dextrorotatory Isoterpinolene. A catalytic hydrogenation gives dextrorotatory 3-para-Menthene. A final step of epoxidation, followed by a rearrangement and a catalytic hydrogenation of the compound obtained forms a mixture of Menthol, separable by fractional distillation. There is a last rather complex process starting fromThymol. This process is not detailed here."

A new catalytic hydrogenation allows to synthesize cis and trans-pinanol, separated by fractional distillation. A pyrolysis of the two separated compounds allows to obtain the two isomers of Linalool separately. Laevorotatoryalpha-Pinenesynthesizes dextrorotatory Linalool and dextrorotatoryalpha-Pinenesynthesizes laevorotatory linalool. Another synthetic route usesMyrcene, synthesized frombeta-Pinene. A hydrohalogenation ofMyrceneleads to the formation of geranyl, neryl and linalyl chlorides. A reaction of this mixture with copper (I) chloride givesLinalyl acetatewith a yield of about 80%. Then, Linalool is obtained by saponification. Finally, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, produced in several possible ways, is converted to Linalool by reaction with ethylene, synthesizing dehydrolinalool, followed by a catalysed hydrogenation by a Lindlar palladium catalyst."

Initially extracted from Musk Tonkin (some qualities of which contain up to 20%). It took 20 years for chemists to succeed in unlocking the secret of its molecular structure. Indeed, at the beginning of the 20th century it was difficult to imagine that a molecule could have more than 6 carbons in its cycle. It was therefore necessary to wait for the arrival of more advanced analytical techniques to understand and assert its structure."

A reaction with diethylamine makes it a major precursor in the synthesis ofL-Menthol.

A photo-oxidation is carried out onCitronellolto synthesize the two allylic hydroperoxides associated with this molecule. The two corresponding diols are obtained by a catalytic hydrogenation. Finally, the two compounds are put in an acid medium (with dilute sulfuric acid for example) in order to obtain a mixture of the two possible isomers of Rose Oxide. The unreacted diols are separated from the reaction medium by a fractional distillation. Using dextrorotatoryCitronellolfor this synthesis yields a 7 : 3 mixture of the cis : trans isomers of Rose Oxide. If the dehydration step is carried out with a stronger acid, an even greater proportion of cis isomer can be obtained. Another synthetic route consists of several stages of halogenation and dehalogenation ofCitronellol."

A high temperature catalytic hydrogenation of these derivatives allows to obtain a new mixture with more isomers. Indeed, the terpenic half of the final molecule may be in axial or equatorial position with respect to the other half of the molecule. 3-trans-Isocamphylcyclohexanol, corresponding to Sandela®, is one of the isomers of the mixture. It is isolated by a fractional distillation. Another method of synthesis starts from Cathecol rather than Guaiacol, and allows to obtain a greater proportion of Sandela® in the final mixture (especially if the hydrogenation step is made under high pressure and catalysed with cobalt)."

Then, a catalytic hydrogenation of the obtained product leads to Silvial®. The second synthetic route is a Friedel and Craft reaction involving isobutylbenzene and Methacrolein diacetate, followed by subsequent acidic hydrolysis of the intermediary product."

It can still be synthesized by reacting isoprene with acrylic acid by a Diels-Alder reaction. Then, the cyclic carboxylic acid obtained is placed in a very strong alkaline medium to allow a reaction with acetone. Therefore, the obtained intermediate molecule contains an alcohol group and a close acid group, and can be esterified by reaction with sulfuryl chloride. Finally, a decarboxylation can be carried out to form the double bond linked to the molecule ring."

Since these processes result in 160 kg of waste per kg of finished product, the synthesis of vanillin tends to be replaced by biosynthetic pathways, from rice bran, natural curcumin or naturalEugenol. The synthesis from lignin is made by an alklaine treatment at high temperature and pressure with oxidants. Vanillin is separated from the other compounds obtained by extraction, distillation and crystallization. Another synthetic route starts from Guaiacol, synthesized from Catechol. Guaiacol condenses to glyoxylic acid in a alklaine medium and at room temperature. Vanillin is obtained by acidification and decarboxylation of the reaction mixture. Another similar process uses Guaiacol and formaldehyde, to obtain the ortho and para-vanillic alcohols. Then, a catalytic oxidation (with palladium and bismuth) allows to obtain Vanillin, separated from the other reaction products by crystallization. Using an excess of formaldehyde involves an oxidation and decarboxylation step, always to obtain Vanillin as the final product. Nowadays, several production processes using biochemistry consist in a bioconversion of ferulic acid,IsoeugenolorEugenol, using bacteria, fungi and plant cells capable of transforming these compounds."

By an Oxy-Cope rearrangement, Velvione® forms by itself (this rearrangement reorganizes the skeleton of certain unsaturated alcohols). The conversion of alcohol to an alcoholate accelerates the rearrangement. In this last step, the alcohol group becomes the ketone group of Velvione®."
