                "info": "Allspice, or Jamaican pepper, is the fruit of a tree that is always green. Its leaves, which look like bay leaves, are fragrant and the berries are even more. The propagation of a crop is done by sowing seeds. The older trees are the ones who give the most fruit and they are used to harvest the seeds. It takes 18 to 20 years for a tree to be at its best crop yield. After ten years, 10 kg of berries can be extracted from a tree each year. The trees are cultivated every three years.From August to October, growers climb the trees to break the branches with their hands. Using an iron ax would actually make the iron react with the tannic acid present in the branches of the tree. An infection like this would kill the tree in two years. Once on the ground, the branches are beaten to make the berries fall. The berries, still green to optimize the extraction yield, are sun-dried for four to ten days, after a possible bath in boiling water (a habit in Guatemala). Drying is sometimes done mechanically to reach a dark brown colour. Then, the berries are crushed and extracted by steam distillation. The essential oil is collected by decantation at the refrigerant outlet.The yield of the essential oil varies from 3 to 4.5%. Moreover, extraction with a volatile solvent or with supercritical CO2can be carried out on the berries to obtain an extract with a different composition. Finally, the leaf of the tree can be extracted with a relatively similar yield and composition."

It was brought back to England where a culture was made until the Second World War, during which the trees were cut.Jamaica is the main exporter of this spice, to the USA, Germany and the United Kingdom in majority, occupying 70% of the market share.Several diseases can affect the leaves of the tree, as well as pests of many types, which can affect the crops and reduce the production.The quality of the Allspice essential oil is checked according to the standards dictated by the Food and Drug Administration Defect Action Levels (FDADAL), by the American Spice Trade Association (ASTA) and the European Spice Association (ESA). Nevertheless, the essential oil can be adulterated withClove Bud EOor Myrtus tabasco essential oil, which is less expensive. For the same reasons, there are also additions of essential oil from the tree leaves orEugenol."

The harvest, done by hand (fruits are very sensitive), begins inNovember and ends around the end of January.The bergamots are stored for 2 to 3 days to warm them and soften the zest.After that, the fruit is put in a sfumatrice to extract the essential oil (cold expression). The sfumatrice works by pricking all the zest of the fruit with needles in order to collect the essential oil and the zest debris. Then these two parts are washed away by a stream of water to a centrifuge. The purpose is to separate the oil from the water and the debris from the peel. Once this separation is done, the essential oil of raw bergamot is collected.The oil can also be obtained by separating the zest of the fruit in a peeler machine and by steam distilling the zest. This essential oil is called  ''distilled bergamot '' or  ''Cold expressed Bergamot ''.The cold expression yield is approximately 0.5%.An extraction with a volatile solvent gives a yield of 4%.The essential oil must be rectified to remove the bergaptenens, which are photosensitizers.This rectification can also be used to isolate terpenes or other compounds from the bergamot.The oul quality varies according to the harvest months: more floral in November (higher presence oflinalool) and cooler in January (higher presence oflinalyl acetate). There is also a  ''black bergamot '' which is an extraction of the zest of an overripe fruit fallen from the tree during the winter whose zest has become black."

The pulp and zest are separated to obtain the juice and the essential oil separately.The extraction is done in the sfumatrice,pricking the zest to extract the aromatic compounds. The essential oil is carried away by a stream of water to be centrifuged, in order to separate the oil from the water and the debris from the peel.The yield of the essential oil of bitter orange is between 1 and 2%.In addition, an orange juice concentration gives an  ''Oil phase '' essential oil. After the extraction of the juice and the essential oil, the leftovers of the fruit, which are called  ''molasses '', allows to collectD-limoneneby distillation. Finally, a fractional distillation of the essential oil allows to separately collect an orange terpenes EO and a deterpenated EO (the percentage of deterpenation is specified) which concentrates the essential oil aldehydes, for more power.The bigaradier gives many extracts. The bitter orange gives an essential oil by cold expression of the fruit. If we treat branches and twigs by hydrodistillation, we obtainPetitgrain Bigarade EO. Finally, if we use the flower, we can obtainOrange Blossom Absolute(extraction with volatile solvent) andNeroli EO(hydrodistillation)."

The cultivation is done on pepper vines, or more rarely in growing pots with a lower yield. In December and January, as they become red, the clusters of black pepper are harvested, stocked a few hours in bags, soaked for 2 minutes in boiling water and dried in the sun for a few days (a quick drying can be done with a dryer at a higher cost). Then, the fruits begin to become brown and wrinkle. The maturity of the spikes depends on the region, the altitude and the temperature of culture among others. The culture is delayed depending on the type of pepper wished for the production.The cultivation in India is done in small plantations where several other plants are grown, while Vietnam and other countries cultivate it in exclusive plantations. A mechanization of the culture is possible, but it only concerns the biggest plantations.After being crushed, the berries are steam distilled for 6 hours. The essential oil is separated by decantation of the water in the distillate. The efficiency of the steam distillation is 2 to 3%. The yields of culture and extraction are better with a plant of 6 to 20 years of age.Black pepper can also be extracted with a volatile solvent to obtain a resinoid with a yield of 6 to 14%. The berries are also extractible with supercritical CO2, to obtain a high olfactory quality at a higher cost."

White pepper is an overripe pepper, or is made from black pepper by a suitable process.Black pepper is the most popular and used spice in the world. It accounts for 34% of international trade in spices. Black pepper is also the first spice that has been introduced to the Western world, and more particularly to the Romans and the Greeks.In 2011, the global pepper production (all combined) was between 320,000 and 350,000 tonnes annually, including about 250,000 tonnes of black pepper.Black pepper is subject to a disease called Phytophthora that tends to affect some plants, lowering the production of some countries. Threats to production in some countries (notably Indonesia) are brought by the mining industry and the replacement of certain plantations by cocoa plantations (in Brazil in particular).Peppers are graded according to their external appearance and according to their size (depending on the drying). We distinguish the grades MG (Malabar Garbled, medium size), TG (Tellicherry Garbled, large), GL (Garbled Light, smaller), PH (Pin Heads, very small) and NS (Non Specified, without a specified size) among others.A pepper essential oil must meet certain physical standards established by the American Spice Trade Association (ASTA) and the European Spice Association (ESA).

Truck box distillation consists in harvesting chamomile and its stem with a harvester by grinding it. The chamomile is extracted inside the harvest box, with a water vapor entry and an exit towards a coolant, where the essential oil is collected.Traditional distillation gives a warmer and herbaceous scent, as both green and volatile molecules have evaporated during the drying step.The extraction yield of blue chamomile is between 3 and 8 ‰.The essential oil of blue camomile can be distilled to be bleached, without a great olfactory deterioration."

The wheat plants are planted three to four months before their harvest and are spaced a few centimetres apart. Then there is winter wheat and spring soft wheat, which are sown in autumn or winter, respectively. This cereal requires very little moisture and a relatively sunny weather. It is the third most widely grown cereal in the world, behind rice and maize, with about 700 million tonnes of wheat produced worldwide each year.Wheat is grown in regularly plowed fields. Ploughing is used to remove weed and insects infestation in the fields. The cultivation of wheat is subject to a simplified cultivation technique (No-till farming), which aims to make soil cultivation easier for all types of plants. For wheat, the seed is introduced directly into the soil, to avoid repetitive plowing which degrades the soil of culture. When it is ripe, the wheat is mown by a combine harvester, and stored in the tank of the machine. When milling wheat, bran is a by-product and it is collected once the flour has been sieved and sifted after the wheat grains have been ground. For 100 kg of sieved wheat, 25 kg of wheat products is obtained, including the wheat bran, separated from the rest of the by-products by a new sieving step.The extraction of bran is done directly after collecting the by-product. It is introduced into anextraction tank filled with hexane.The extraction lasts a few hours, then the solvent is evaporated and recycled. The concrete is obtained after removing the plant and the evaporating the solvent. The waxes of this paste are not soluble in alcohol. The concrete has to be diluted inethanoland subjected to glazing to precipitate the waxes, which are removed from the mixture by filtration. After evaporation of the solvent, the absolute is collected."

The cane juice is filtered and then pumped to the fermentation tanks.Fermentation is allowed by the addition of yeasts, transforming the sugar into alcohol. 24 hours of fermentation allows to obtain a  ''cane wine '' containing 5% alcohol. A distillation is then necessary to increase this percentage and obtain white rum, after storage in wooden barrels for 3 months. Brown rum is stored much longer, and generally reaches 18 months of storage in barrels, which explains its coloring.For perfumery, brown rum absolute is obtained by distilling brown rum to remove the alcohol and only keep the odoriferous ingredients, recovered in the distillation flask."

It is cultivated for its wood, from which an essential oil is obtained all year round. However, the extraction yield is better in summer.The wood is depressed into logs of about 80cm in diameter, and stored in the open air, in stacks.Before extraction, the wood is shredded into chips and then introduced into the extractor.To obtain the essential oil, the extraction is made with steam, under pressure, for several hours, to obtain the oil at the end of the process by settling over the cade hydrolate.Another method of extraction, calleddry or empyreumatic distillation,consists of pyrolyzing the wood in a furnace at 900 to 1000°C.In this extraction, the fumes are recovered and condensed to get a product called  ''Cade Oil ''.This oil contains many molecules called benzopyrenes, that are carcinogenic, and is black in colour. To reduce the benzopyrene level from around 1000 ppm to 10 ppm, a rectification is made. The oil is placed under high vacuum to evaporate only the most volatile compounds, with relatively poor heating (maximum temperature reached at the head of the distillation column: 220°C). Then, the final product is called  ''Rectified Cade '', which is light brown in colour and contains few carcinogenic compounds.Nevertheless, it is nowadays generally the essential oil of cade that is used in perfumery, to avoid any presence of benzopyrene, without altering its smell."

The fields need to be very sunny, with moderate temperatures.The propagation of a crop is done by sowing caraway seeds from March to April (in temperate zone) and from October to November (in sub-tropical zone), with a space of a few tens of centimetres between each plant. For each hectare of cultivated land, 8 to 10 kg of seeds are needed. The cultivation is carried out 4 to 15 months after planting the seeds, and allows to cultivate 1 to 3 tons of seeds per hectare cultivated, depending on the type of seed (the yield is better for the biennial caraway).After the cultivation, the seeds are rinsed and dried until a 10-12% moisture content and stored in bags away from moisture and light. Before the extraction,seeds are crushed to improve the yield of the essential oil. At the end of the process, the extraction is made by hydro distilling the dry seedto obtain the essential oil by decantation. The extraction yield is between 70 and 160 kg of essential oil per hectare of culture, meaning the seedsyield is of 30 to 60‰.An extraction with volatile solventis possible and provides a warm, aromatic and pleasant smell.Another distillation allows to bleach the essential oiland to extract the natural D-Carvone."

Many olfactive variations may occur according to the culture locations, the forests and even between trees of a same forest.Cinnamon tree has a very easy to peel bark. Cultivators first take off the grey external bark of the tree. They peel it to remove the undesired dry parts, and keep the rest for drying and extraction. The rest of the tree is cut down to peel the internal parts of the tree. Shavings are then gathered on palets and brought to the plant for drying, using local animals. Strips are dried for a few days in the shade, to avoid the bark from burning. A double spiral is observed, making the difference with Ceylon cinnamon, for which the spiral is unique.After drying, strips are extracted as they are, or slightly crushed to enhance the extraction yield. In a steam distillation tank, steam is injected under pressure to be condensed at the top of the column, to make the oil settle over the water. For a 5 to 8 hours extraction, the yield is in the order of 1 to 2%.The distillation can be done on site, or directly by the companies that produces the essential oil, in Western Europe or in North America.Cinnamon oleoresincan be obtained from the extraction of the bark with a volatile solvent.Usingethanolgives a yield of 10 to 12%, while using benzene leads to a yield of 2 to 4%.Cassia essential oil is a major precursor for the extraction of naturalCinnamaldehyde."

This pocket is both present in the male and the female. The beaver must be killed in order to collect the secretion pocket.The resinoid results from drying the pocket for one to two years, grinding and then dyeing it in the alcohol. This dyeing is generally carried out by mixing about 20 parts of alcohol by weight depending on the mass of the bags. A small amount of potash can be added to promote the extraction.The overall yield of the extraction is relatively high: 45 to 75% castorum resin is soluble in alcohol.Sometimes, the pockets drying is done with the smoke of a wood fire. This practice gives the extract a smokier and more violent smell, bringing it closer to the birch tar note.The castoreum resinoid can be distilled to be bleached,without a great olfactory deterioration."

It lives on limestone soils in the USA, and does not require a large drainage or much sun exposition.The trunk of this juniper is cut to be ground, leaving the roots implanted, then thechips and the sawdust are extracted by steam distillation.At the end of the process, the essential oil is obtained in an essencier by decantation of the water.Itis possible to perform a second distillation to obtain a rectified EO.This consists in obtaining 30 fractions of the EO, to reconstitute it without the undesiered fractions (too animalic for some of them).Theessential oil yield is 2.5%.

In 2006, Sri Lanka produced 90% of Ceylon cinnamon worldwide.The leaves and the bark are mature 12 to 18 months after the preceding harvest. From red to dark green, the colour of the leaves indicates the cinnamon maturity. The culture often takes place in May and November. The bark of the cinnamon tree is very friable and can easily be detached from the trunk by sliding a knife between the two parts.The older the tree, the greater the bark yield per hectare is important.After separating the trunk, the pieces of bark are stacked, pressed and dried overnight in the shade to avoid sunburns, for four to five days. In wet weather, the use of a desiccator may be necessary. The bark shrinks, browns and develops its olfactory potential.This is when cinnamon can be extracted by steaming.The extraction is practiced on the strips of bark as such or slightly crushed. After distillation, the essential oil is collected by decantation in a florentine vase. The quality of the essential oil depends on the part of the extracted trunk. Its quality is better if it is the center of the trunk.Corrections are made to standardize the quality of the essential oil.The distillation can be done on site, or directly by the companies that produces the essential oil, in Western Europe or in North America. France is the largest importer of Sri Lanka cinnamon essential oil, followed by the United States.Many olfactory variations can occur depending on crops, forests and even between trees in the same forest.Cinnamon oleoresin can be obtainedfrom the extraction of the bark with a volatile solvent.Usingethanolgives a yield of 10 to 12%, while using benzene leads to a yield of 2 to 4%."

Leaves from this tree are not extracted for perfumery.We can also distinguishCinnamomum burmanni: Korintje cassia SFE andCinnamomum tamala: Indian cinnamon, much less cultivated.The difference between the two types of cinnamon lies in the way they are dried. Cassia dries forming two spirals, whereas Ceylon cinnamon forms thin layers of wood which crumble easily. The chinese variety is also darker and harder. Ceylon cinnamon has a more zesty and terpenic smell than the Chinese cinnamon, which contains moreCinnamaldehyde."

From red to dark green, the colour of the leaves indicates the cinnamon maturity. The culture often takes place in May and November. The leaves are collected by cutting the twigs off the tree and separating the leaves from the branches.The leaves are ground and dried before they are extracted by steam distillation.About 1 hectare of cinnamon forest allows to cultivate 1 ton of leaves, offering a yield of 2.5 to 3 kg of essential oil(extraction yield: 0.3%)."

We use the latter in perfumery.In July, from dawn to noon, new branches are cut with a sickle, bundled and taken to the factory to extract the gum. It will then be necessary to wait another 3 years to harvest the cistus again.To obtain the resinoid, the gum is treated in a soda solution for extraction with a 3 to 5% yield. After filtration, an acid treatment is carried out. A pasty product is recovered by skimming and distilled to dry it. The paste is finally treated with alcohol, then filtered to remove insoluble compounds. A  ''labdanum alcohol resinoid '' is then obtained.Several reprocessing are possible on the cistus absolute, to remove insoluble compounds or colour. Such rectification has no olfactory impact."

It is necessary to wait a few months, around May-June, for a new shoot to appear. This new branch protects itself from the sun - and from the summer heat of southern Spain - by secreting a very fragrant viscous gum. We use the latter in perfumery.In July, from dawn to noon, new branches are cut with a sickle, bundled and taken to the factory to extract the gum. It will then be necessary to wait another 3 years to harvest the cistus again.To obtain the resinoid,the gum is treated in a soda solutionfor extraction with a3 to 5% yield.After filtration, an acid treatment is carried out. A pasty product is recovered by skimming and distilled to dry it. The paste is finally treated with alcohol, then filtered to remove insoluble compounds. A  ''labdanum alcohol resinoid '' is then obtained.Several reprocessing are possible on thecistus absolute, to remove insoluble compounds or colour. Such rectification has no olfactory impact."

This disease is deadly for citrus fruits and no treatment exists. It is transmitted by a vector insect that attacks young shoots: the psylla. This results in the premature death of many trees and therefore the decline in the general production of the essential oil and its quality (reduction of theD-Limonenelevel).The sarcodactylis variety of citron is also called  ''hand of bouddha '', because of its shape."

Also, the addition of chemical substances such as anIndole-Acetic Acid orIndole-Butyric Acid complex on the crops increases the level of essential oil in the plant.After four to five months cultivation,when four or five leaves are fully open, the roots of the plant are hand grown.They are trimmed to keep the root from the white end to the green stem, with its long green leaves. The next crop can take place 60 to 90 days later andthe number of crops per year does not exceed four or five.The plant is dried and inserted whole in the extractor. After asteam distillationunder high pressure, the essential oil is collected in an essencier by decantation. About30kg of lemongrass is needed to obtain 1kg of essential oil.Often, the oil is distilled again under vacuum to remove colouring and impurities.The essential oil must be stored in metal or aluminium containers.

The secretion contained in these pockets is extractable and obtained by scraping or squeezing this gland. Both male and female has this pocket but males are the first targets for extraction because their pockets are more abundant. Each month, the animal can produce 20 to 30 grams of secretion. The captivity conditions of the animal affect the amount of secretion and the quality depends on the food given to the animal and its storage.Initially, the secretion has a pale yellow colour and becomes brown when in contact with air. The colour of the secretion also depends on the animal diet.Extraction is done with a volatile solvent to obtain the absolute by glazing the secretion in alcohol, then a filtration is done to remove the solvent. Any adulteration of the secretion made by feeding the animal with potatoes (for example) can be detected by its extraction efficiency. If it is more than 60%, there is adulteration. If it is between 50 and 60%, the extract has a good quality. If it is between 40 and 50%, the quality is intermediate.The civet absolute can be rectified to be bleached, without a great olfactory deterioration."

The leaves are manually removed and placed in cloth bags, taken to the factory to crush and dry the leaves, after weighing the bags. After drying, the leaves are sent to the extractor, where their steam distillation allows to recover an essential oil with a yield of about 3.5%, after 8 hours of extraction. The essential oil of clove leaf is recovered at the end of the process in a decanter, separating from the distillation water.Indonesia produces about 2500 tons of essential oil of clove leaf each year. This essential oil is mainly used to extract naturalEugenol.In addition, it should be noted that cloves can also be extracted to obtain clove essential oil. It contains about the same level ofEugenolbut is much more concentrated inEugenyl Acetateat the expense of Caryophyllene."

Some 100,000 flowers can grow from the trunk of the tree, but few of them give birth to fruits (pods). The crop yield of a cocoa tree is optimal when it is 6 to 7 years old on average. Pods weighing 400 g and 15 to 20 cm long can be born on the branches and directly on the trunk of the tree. A tree can give birth to an average of 150 pods per year, used to produce 6 kg of cocoa. A pod is considered mature if it has a yellow-orange hue.The pods are harvested by cutting them at their base. For high pods, sticks equiped with a blade are used. Once on the ground, the pod is opened in half with a long knife, and the beans are detached from the inside of the pod, and placed on banana leaves.Once brought back to the factory, they are arranged in thick layers, separated by banana leaves, in a wooden box, for a few days. This leads to maceration and a first development of the aromatic compounds of the beans.Once this first maceration is completed, the beans are dried in the sun on large pallets and regularly turned over. They are finally stored in canvas bags to be brought to Europe for roasting and extraction.The beans are cleaned, sensitized on a vibrating plate to make the shells crumbly, sieved to separate the shell from the grain. Roasting is carried out between 100 and 140°C, to dry the seed, evaporate its volatile acids and above all develop the aromatic compounds of cocoa. Finally, the beans are ground to powder by a grinding phase before extraction.Extraction is done by contacting the ground seeds with a volatile solvent such as cyclohexane.After filtration and evaporation of the solvent, the cocoa concrete is recovered and solubilized in alcohol. A cooling of the alcohol, called chilling, precipitates the cocoa waxes to keep only the fragrant compounds of this seed: the absolute.A cocoa absolute can be discoloured by distillation, with no much effect on its olfactory characteristics."

Many mentions of coriander cultures are also present in the Bible.This essential oil allows the isolation ofLinaloolup to 90%for a very little ripe coriander seed.The composition of the essential oil of coriander depends greatly on the geographical origin of the plant and its maturity.The quality of the seed can be damaged by insects, chemical (especially antioxidants) and microbial (Salmonella) agents. Standards of quality are shaped by the AFNOR (French Association of Standards), the ESA (European Spice Association) or the AGMARK (Spices Grading and Marking Rules) in India. These specifications concern the quality of the seed and the leaf, as well as the physicochemical properties of the essential oil.Adulteration is possible with a diverse crops communal pot that contains seeds that are not ripe or overripe, or by adding syntheticLinalool."

Cypriol cultivation is then comparable to that of vetiver (Vetiver Java EO,Vetiver Haiti EO). The leaves are grouped together before uprooting the plant. The roots are shaken by hand to remove some of the soil, then transported to the essential oil production plant. There they are washed and dried in the sun, removing all the remaining soil and developing the aromatic potential of the root.Extraction is done using pressurized steam, taking the aromatic molecules from the plant to the top of the distillation column. Refrigeration of the vapours liquefies them and allows the essential oil to be recovered in a Florentine flask, by settling over the water used for distillation.As the essential oil is orange to brown, it can be rectified to remove the colour. It can also be used to remove natural Cyperene, Rotundone or Rotundene."

They are placed in sacks before they are brought to the factory, where the bags are weighed. It is best to extract the fresh roses to produce the essential oil. Although, these can not all be extracted at once. Therefore, to avoid maceration problems, it is advisable to keep them fresh and protected from moisture.Every day about 200 tons of roses can be extracted, combining hydrodistillations and volatile solvent extractions. The firstextraction with hexanegives a concrete after removing the flowers from the extractor and evaporating the solvent. The concrete can be diluted in the alcohol in order to precipitate the waxes, by glazing the mixture with a temperature gradient of 140 °F. to 32 °F.

The crop starts early in the morning, around 6am, and ends in the late morning. Ideally, the roses that are picked should be half open, to ensure a good extraction yield. They are placed in sacks before they are brought to the factory, where the bags are weighed. It is best to extract the fresh roses to produce the essential oil. Although, these can not all be extracted at once. Therefore, to avoid maceration problems, it is advisable to keep them fresh and protected from moisture.Every day about 200 tons of roses can be extracted, combining hydrodistillations and volatile solvent extractions.Roses are steam distilled.The essential oil is collected after a few hours of distillation in a florentine vase by decantation of the rose water.The smell of the oil is more lemony and fresh than theDamask rose absolute, which is warmer and waxy.The production of 1 kg of rose essential oil requires the harvest of 3500 to 4000 kg of rose and has ayield of 0.25‰, which explains the price of this raw material."

This is why it is grown mainly in India where it is also used to make garlands and bouquets.The botanical name  ''pallens '' refers to its foliage, often grey.The quality of a Davana essential oil is measured by its amount of Davanone : a high quality oil contains more than 50%, although a rate of about 45% of Davanone is generally more common.Surprisingly, the major component of the essential oil, cis-davanone, has no smell. The power of the essential oil smell comes mainly from the presence of ethers such as furans, dihydrofurans and dihydrorosefurans, among others. However, all these compounds are present at less than 2.5% in the essential oil.From 2008, the quality of the production of Davana essential oil dropped due to the increasing demand and climatic conditions difficulting the growth in India. Therefore, essential oils contains less Davanone.Curiously, the quantity of davana essential oil exported in 2009 doubled, causing an upward trend in the number of crops and lower prices. In addition, the cultivation of davana does not require the use of synthetic products and cultures do not carry disease. Irrigation is an additional source of costs for farmers and represents 20% of the total cultivation cost. For this reason, several rainwater recycling projects are being developed."

We use the latter in perfumery.In July, from dawn to noon, new branches are cut with a sickle, bundled and taken to the factory to extract the gum. It will then be necessary to wait another 3 years to harvest the cistus again.Dynamone® is derived from cistus concrete.To obtain the concrete, the gum is treated in a soda solution for extraction with a 3 to 5% yield. After filtration, an acid treatment is carried out. A pasty product is recovered by skimming and distilled to dry it. This paste undergoes various fractionning and co-distillations to obtain the final product, Dynamone®, whose process belongs to the producing company.The Dynamone® goal is to bring out ambery and mineral notes to the extract.

Its protection is therefore a major challenge.

They ensure a rigorous and transparent follow-up of the productions, leading to a better valuation of both the product and the producers."

A single tree can yield up to 5kg of resin annually for a harvest carried out from July to March.All the resin recovered is stored in a warehouse while waiting to be extracted.Several types of extraction can be performed with this resin:Steam extraction:Usually performed in Europe to obtain theElemi EO. It takes in general 5.5kg of resin to obtain 1kg of essential oil -Yield of 18 %.SFE extraction:Usually done in Europe, this process allows to obtain Elemi SFE.

In some processes,the pressure can reach 5 to 10 bar in the steel tank.At the end of the extraction process, the essential oil is collected by decantation of the water.The extraction yield of the deciduous branches oscillates between 0.5 and 3%.Young leaves have a better extraction yield.The essential oil can be rectifiedto remove parasite smells by adding soda.

This tree lives up to 150 years.The fragrant principle of the tree is contained in the twigswith its needles arranged one by one with a cone shape.In autumn, the balsam fir twigs are cut by hand and taken to the factory where they are weighed andextracted fresh with hexane.For the extraction, twigs are placed on grids inside of a tank and hexane is added next. To obtain the concrete, the branches are removed from the tank and the solvent is evaporated for recycling. This concrete is diluted in alcohol to precipitate the waxes by glazing (temperature gradient from 140 °F to 32 °F). The absolute is obtained after the filtration and evaporation of the alcohol.Sometimes, theFir Basalm absolute can be distilled to be bleached,without a great olfactory impact."

Its hybrid with sweet orange gave birth to clementine.Orange-(Citrus sinensis)is famous for the cultivation of its fruits, whose juice and essential oil are extracted in Brazil and California in particular, which is the most used of all perfumes.Grapefruit-(Citrus paradisii)of Malay origin, is cultivated for its essential oil in Brazil and Israel in particular.Yuzu-(Citrus junos),produced in Japan and Korea."

The cultivation of this fruit requires sunshine and great periods of heat.The fruits are grown from January to June.A second harvest can happen if the weather conditions are favourable. Harvest can be done manually or mechanically according to the growers. In the case of a mechanical cultivation, a tractor passes between the tree rows to shake the fruits and collect them into a receptacle. The fruits are transported to the factory where they are sorted and washed with water.The second step is to squeeze the essential oil of the citrus zest in a sfumatrice.Then, the essential oil and zest debris are washed away to a centrifuge to separate the oil from the water and the waxes. After that, the essential oil is collected.The yield of grapefruit essential oil is between 0.16 and 0.2%.Grapefruit can be deterpened by fractional distillation of the essential oil to separately collect grapefruit terpenes and a deterpenated essential oil, which concentrates the essential oil aldehydes, giving it more power."

It was crossed for the first time in 1750 in Barbados, hence its original name of  ''Barbados grapefruit ''. Its name is taken from Dutch.Florida is the largest producer of grapefruit.Grapefruit can be used to extract naturalD-Limonene, although orange is preferred, as it concentrates more.The molecule that gives grapefruit its olfactory typicity isNootkatone, present at 1% in the essential oil.Citrus currently suffer from a disease called  ''citrus greening ''. This disease is deadly for citrus fruits and no treatment exists. It is transmitted by a vector insect that attacks young shoots: the psylla. This results in the premature death of many trees and therefore the decline in the general production of the essential oil and its quality (reduction of theD-Limonenelevel)."

However, to obtain the essential oil from the branches, the process is different as the extraction is done on the branches AND the berries byhydrodistillation.The yield is between 2 and 5%.This makes a difference to the process because the presence of branches prevents the production of gin, the main reason for the cultivation of this tree."

After removal of the plants and evaporation of the extraction solvent, this first extraction gives a laminaria concrete. During the second step, the waxes of the concrete are precipitated by a dilution in alcohol and a glazing step with a temperature gradient from 140 °F to 32°F. After filtration of the precipitated mixture and evaporation of the alcohol, the absolute is collected.The molecular distillation phase(MD)of the extract is carried out in a distillation tank at very low pressure. The objective of this operation is to clear the absolute from any substance giving it its original dark green colour, and to eliminate all the residual waxes of the extract.

The production of lavandin requires a certain altitude, located between 600 and 1500 meters.The cultivation and extraction are done in August-September. The Lavandin extraction process is called  ''ground green '' which means that it is done directly after cutting. Once they are ground, the plants are grouped in the extraction tank. The smell of the absolute is greener and cooler than if the plant was dried in the sun before extraction. A first extraction with hexane gives a concrete that is collected after the solvent has evaporated and the flowers are removed. After that, the concrete is diluted in an alcohol solution and subjected to a gradual glazing submitting the mixture at a temperature of 32 °F. During this process, the waxes precipitates and the mixture of alcohol and absolute are collected. The absolute is collected after evaporation of the alcohol.The extraction yield is better for lavandin than for lavender because it contains more flower heads.The lavandin absolute can be rectified by distillation to be obtained without terpene or colour."

The Lavandin extraction process is called  ''ground green '' which means that it is done directly after cutting. Once they are ground, the plants are grouped in the distillation tank. The smell of the absolute is greener and cooler than if the plant was dried in the sun before the hydrodistillation. The essential oil is collected at the end of the steam distillation, by decantation.The extraction yield is better for lavandin than for lavender because it contains more flower heads. Its extraction yield is 120 kg of essential oil per hectare, against 40 kg of oil per hectare of cultivated lavender (Aspic has a yield of 50 kg / ha).The annual production of lavandin grosso essential oil reaches 1200 kg. The essential oil can be rectified to be obtained without terpene. It can also be acetylated to increase its level ofLinalyl Acetateif it has to be extracted later."

The label is awarded by a jury of experts after an olfactory evaluation. Other labels such as the ECO-Cert, Qualité-France and SOCOTEC labels can be attributed to organiclavender absoluteproductions.On the lavender plant population, the leafhopper, an insect feeding on plant sap, bites the plants causing their death. Kaolin is a pesticide used to control this insect, which does not attack clonal lavender plants.Many adulterations can occur regarding the absolute lavender. It can be adulterated by other types of lavender with a lower cost, by aLavandin Absolute, by addition of synthetic compounds such asLinalyl Acetate,Linalool,Coumarin,Ocimeneor other terpenes. Compliance with production standards is validated by chromatographic analysis.Each molecule must have a minimum and maximum rate in the produces absolute."

This oil is driven to a centrifuge by a stream of water and centrifuged twice after the filtration of the residual zest. The zest is collected to be steam distilled during 4 hours. Thus, one oil is obtained bycold press,and another by steaming.The extraction yield of lemon zest is between 0.3 and 0.5%.It is also possible to perform a less common hydrodistillation,starting from the fresh peel. For this method, the fruit passes directly into apeeling machineto separate the zest from the pulp and extract the fruit peel only.The essential oil can be deterpened or desesquiterpened,to increase the intensity (a deterpenation concentrates the essential oil aldehydes) or for regulatory reasons (furocoumarins withdrawal, photosensitizers ...).The lemon tree is also at the origin of another essential oil, obtained from its leaves, calledPetitgrain Lemon EO."

The multiplication of the plants is done by dividing the rhizomes and tubers of the plant. Seed sowing is also practiced, always in shallow water. Planting seed in March, flowers will appear in August or September. For a rhizome plantation, flowering will be observed as early as July.The lotus feeds on the mud at the bottom of ponds. In winter, the flower disappears and the stem shrinks and buries itself inside the pond. The colder it gets, the more the plant buries itself for protection, then grows again when the water warms up from spring onwards.In perfumery,the flower is treated to obtain an absolute. It is put in warm hexane for several hours.Once this first extraction is completed, the flowers are removed and the solvent is evaporated. A concrete is obtained. This extract contains the waxes of the plant. A second extraction is necessary to precipitate them and only keep its odorous principle. For this, chilling in alcohol is applied. After filtration and evaporation of the alcohol, the Lotus Flower absolute is obtained."

The leaves can reach 50 to 60 centimetres long, and the root measures 40 to 50 cm.Three essential oils are commonly produced from this plant: Lovage Rhizome EO, Lovage Leaf EO and Lovage Seed EO, by descending production value and ascending price order.Temperate climate regions (6 to 18°C) are the most likely for lovage culture, with strong sun exposure and abundant drainage. Sowing of the seeds is done in automn, to start harvesting one year later. Propagation can also be done by dividing the rhizome. Soils are fertilized thanks to nitrogen, phosphorous compounds and potassium dioxide.Lovage plants are renewed every 3 to 4 years. Leaves appear only after two years of culture. They make it possible to harvest 4 kg of fresh leaves per year and per square metre from this period, e.g. 4 to 6 tons per hectare, leading to only 2 to 4 kg of essential oil. For seeds, 400 to 600 kg can be harvested every year, leading to 3 to 6 kg of essential oil. For the rhizomes, 6 to 8 tons per hectare are cultivated and 5 to 6 kg of oil can be obtained each year.After being harvested, theleaves are dried up before steam distillation.Under pressure, steam enters the distillation tank and takes the odorous compounds from the leaves. Vapours are condensed on top of the column and the essential oil is recovered with a0,5 to 1% yieldby settlement over water in a florentine flask, which explains the price of the oil. Being rich in furocoumarins, lovage oil can be rectified to obtain a less toxic essential oil, as forBergamot EO."

It is a fragile plant and many factors can affect the quality of its essential oil. For example, the conditioning of seeds with gibberellic acid has a beneficial effect on the extraction yield, without affecting the composition of the essential oil. The extraction yield is also affected by the average temperature on the crop. The higher the temperature, the better the yield.In Egypt, marjoram is grown from March to July. In France, it is from September to November. The cultivation should be done before the plants bloom and a second cut of the plants can be made two months after the first. The plants are cut 5 cm above the ground and the leaves are dried in the sun or in a ventilated room from a few hours to a few days. Storage is protected from light and moisture in a cold place.The dry leaves are hydro-distilled under pressure in a distillation tank for 1h30 to 3h.The essential oil is collected in a florentine vase by decantation, after refrigerating the water vapor.The yield of the essential oil varies from 1 to 3‰. The first year is better compared to the following years. It is also optimal for the second cut of leaves.Extraction is possible using supercritical CO2which gives a higher olfactory quality, slightly modifying the composition of the essential oil."

During this month, farmers mow the flowers using a comb, a rolling utensil in which flowers get stuck and are withdrawn from their stems. Mechanical evolutions of this utensil have recently been used to increase the yield and efficiency of flower crops (harvests are 100 kg per day with a rolling comb, against 1 ton per day with a suitable machine). Flowers are collected in canvas bags and weighed one by one before they are brought to the factory where they are put on the ground. Regularly, the flowers are stirred with the shovel to move air through them.The harvest period usually extends from late May to mid-June.After that, theflowers are placed on extraction grids into a tank and are subjected to three successive macerations in hexane(45min - 35min - 25min).After removing the flowers and evaporating the hexane, the concrete is collected.Exhausted flowers are discarded and hexane is recycled to extract other flowers. The concrete is diluted in alcohol (ratio: 1 of flowers / 6 of alcohol) to precipitate the waxes by a glazing process during which the mixture is subjected to a temperature gradient going from 140 °F to 32 °F. The narcissus absolute is obtained after evaporation of the alcohol.The yield is 750 g of absolute for 1 ton of flowers."

The absolute is obtained by extracting the concrete with alcohol. The concrete waxes are precipitated by a glazing with a temperature gradient from 140 °F to 32 °F.The absolute yield is between 1.5 and 4%.Part of the colour can be removed from the absolute by treatment with activated carbon, or almost completely by molecular distillation."

The yield out of the obtention of the essential oil is always better during the hot flowering season, rather than the cold winter, even if oregano is a perennial plant. Its growth is majorly wild, but can also be controlled after 3 or 4 month of growth, under greenhouse. Propagation is done by sowing (during spring) or cutting, depending on the regions of culture, and the plant is cultivated once or twice a year. Plants are spaced-apart from at least 10 cm. One plantation can reach up to 63 000 plants per hectare. Soil can be treated with ammonium phosphate to enhance the harvesting yield.Cutting of the plant starts when half of the plants have flowered, during warm season. Cutting is done manually, for about 1260 cumulated hours per hectare (labour supply represents the major part of the price of oregano). After harvesting, stems are dried in the shade for a few hours, to reach 7 to 12% of humidity. Leaves can also be frozen to extract them later.Once dry, stems are compacted in a steam distillation tank.Under pressure, steam is injected in the tank and takes volatile compounds to the top of the distillation column. Inone hour and a half,essential oil is obtained by decanting after being liquefied with a0,08% yield,which is very low. This can explain the low usage of oregano in perfumes and its price."

After harvesting, iris rhizomes are trimmed and washed.There are then several types of process before putting the rhizomes to dry. In some (rare) regions of the world such as Tuscany or a little in Morocco, the rhizomes are peeled and cleaned after harvesting (this is called  ''white '' iris). This process is complex because it cannot be mechanized and must be done by hand. It does, however, result in a much better olfactory quality. The huge majority of global production does not undergo this process and is  ''simply '' sliced mechanically (known as  ''black '' iris).Whatever the process,they are then left to dry in the sun for several days.At this stage, the rhizomes are still almost odorless. This drying is essential because it determines the degree of maturation of the rhizomes, an important factor in the rate of transformation of irone, itself a factor in the olfactory quality of the butter or Iris absolute.Three more years of drying then follow,during which the rhizome synthesizes molecules called irones, chemically close to ionones. This step is crucial to obtain the olfactory quality of the root.(A bacterial treatment can accelerate the maturation of the roots from three years to just a few days! However, the treatment has a negative impact on the olfactory quality of the root).Rhizomes are then powdered and undergo molecular hydrodistillation(under 0.5 to 1.5 bar pressure and for about 15 hours), to obtain a Iris Butter (concrete) with ayield of about 0.2%.This butter can then undergo fractional distillation to obtain Iris Absolute with ayield of about 0.04%from the rhizomes.Iris powder can also be treated directly with volatile solventsto obtain Iris Resinoid with ayield of about 3 to 4%.These yields as well as the time required for production explain the cost of this raw material.In terms of production, the concrete that is preferred, about 200kg are produced each year, containing about 10-20% irone, sold at approx. 10k€/Kg. Only a few kilos of Absolute d'Iris are produced, containing more than 60% irone, sold at approx. 50k€/Kg. Resinoid is not much produced."

Since 1850, the use of Iris Florentina declines in favour of Iris Pallida. Nowadays, Iris pallida is used more because its yield is better and its smell is more powdery and closer to violet. Since its introduction in perfumery with Vera Violeta- Roger & Gallet (1892), Iris has been the happiness of all perfumers. At once warm and dry, sensual and creamy, powdery and oily, its scent is unique. It can be found in many fragrances, and a large majority of niche ranges have an iris perfume. However, this scent is often reproduced because the price of Iris butter does not allow regular use."

This price is around 12 000 € / kg for butter and can go up to 40 000 € / kg for the absolute.It is historically one of the most expensive and most coveted raw material of perfumery.Natural Irones (alpha-irone, beta, gamma) can be obtained from the butter or the absolute. The synthesis of these molecules is preferred for cost reasons.The term  ''iris '' means  ''rainbow '' in Greek, illustrating the colour variety of the flowers found in this kind of plant.The iris absolute can be favoured in a composition for its stability (it does not precipitate) and orris root butter for its price.Between the 1970s and 2000, Iris crop has undergone a major crisis in terms of output volume. This led to a rarefaction of this product already considered noble. This crisis allowed the development of new production areas, almost non-existent until then, such as Morocco. Today, production has gradually returned to sufficient volumes to meet the needs of the perfumery industry, although Iris is still considered a premium product.Orris is the iconic flower of Florence city so much that it appears on the city's coat of arms."

The propagation of a crop can be done by sowing seeds as osmanthus grows berries rather quickly this way although the culture yield will be lower, or by an asexual production that requires a treatment of the plant beforehand.To obtain a good crop yield, osmanthus should be grown at the north of a sub-tropical region, in a mountainous region, with a high sun exposure and on a very fertile soil.The flowers are picked by hand during the month of December in China.They must be picked during the day, as the flowers wilt quickly. Before the extraction, the flowers are immersed in brine to improve their preservation.An extraction of the fresh flowers with hexaneallows to collect a concrete after evaporating the solvent. The solvent is collected and recycled to extract other flowers, while the exhausted flowers are thrown away. Then, the concrete is diluted in alcohol and submitted to a glazing process at a temperature gradient of 140 °F to 32 °F in order to precipitate the waxes of the concrete. The absolute is obtained by filtration and evaporation of the alcohol.The overall extraction yield is about 1.2%.In China, about only 1 ton of concrete is produced each year, which explains the cost of this raw material."

Sowing is usually done in spring, in a slightly acid soil, putting space between the plants.The leaves aspect in the major plant maturity indication.Parlsey harvesting can be done manually or mecanically, although the manual method is prefered, not to damage the plant. Stems are grouped and cut a few centimeters above the soil. Stems are attached together to be stored. Cutting is usually done between april and december, that is to say alsmost all year. The best quality of parsley is obtained for plants sown at the beggining of springtime and cultivated at the end of the season.The seeds are recovered from buds manually and are kept to be extracted or the be sown again.After drying for a few days, the seeds are placed in a steam distillation tank.Steam is injected under high pressure and vapours are condensed at the top of the column. The oil is recovered by settling over the distillation water, in a florentine flask.Leaves(Parsley Leaf EO) and seed of the plant can also be extracted,but have their particular smell, with simillar components. It's also possible to find Parsley Leaf Oleoresin and Parsley Seed Oleoresin.

The cultivation of this shrub being particularly greedy, it significantly impoverishes the soils and does not allow to maintain production at the same place for more than 5 years. Once the soil is impoverished, it becomes unusable for almost 10 years. Thus, crops were gradually relocated to the island of Sulawesi, the current world production center (now accounts for approximately two-thirds of global output involving some 30,000 – 40,000 producers). It is also possible to find patchouli crops in the Philippines, India, Malaysia and Madagascar, but production volumes are particularly low and quality is generally lower."

                "info": "Plants are propagated by cutting because patchouli does not produce flowers and even fewer fruits. Plants are then arranged into rows, separated by a few tens of centimetres.The main harvest takes place during the wet season, from December to January,after 5 to 9 months of growth, early in the morning or late in the evening (this avoids the heat and thus the evaporation of the essential oil contained in the leaves). Leaves are picked one by one, without the stems. The subsequent harvests can take place every 3 to 6 months for 2 to 3 years. First cuts are generally more interesting from an olfactory and a yield point of view. Patchouli grows better at elevations of between 200 – 300 metres above sea level. Initially patchouli was grown in Sulawesi at sea level but growing at higher elevations improved patchouli quality with a higher PA and lower acidic value.In order to get the most oil from the leaves, they are dried in the shade for about 1 week, turned over and then stored in a dry place (this increases the permeability of the leaves and allows to release a large part of the essential oil contained in the leaf itself). This step induces a loss of about 80 to 85% of the initial weight of the leaf. Similarly, the longer the drying process, the higher the quality of the essential oil. However, this waiting time reduces the yield.After drying, leaves are ready to be extracted by steam distillation under pressure for 6 to 24 hours.Again, several types of distillation can take place. Differences mainly regarding the nature of the extraction tank. Indeed, in the poorest regions (Sumatra for example) tanks are made of iron and the volumes treated are very small. Iron is not optimal for patchouli because it is then found in the essential oil (Phenols contained in the EO react and form ferrous ions) and brings nothing more than instability (coloration). Products extracted by this way (approximately 10-20% of the world production) must then undergo a process known as  ''de-ironation '' (treatment with citric acid, for example) in order to recover an interesting quality. This is known as''Patchouli de-ironed ''.For several years now, producers, supported by the perfume industry, have been able to develop their production techniques and are now able to distillate more than 80% of the world's production in stainless steel vats capable of holding almost 10x the volume. These innovations have made it possible to gradually eliminate the iron removal stage. This is known as''Patchouli light ''.Regardless of the distillation method used,the yield between the dry leaves and the essential oil is below 2%.Once distillation has been carried out, the EO undergoes a maturation stage of a few days in order to evaporate the first top notes considered as unpleasant (sulfuric notes).It should also be noted that it is possible to obtain''Patchouli Heart ''after fractional distillation. In the latter, only the central fraction of the essential oil is kept. Top and bottom fractions are removed. It is also possible to obtain''Patchouli DM ''by molecular distillation. Finally, an extraction with volatile solvents is also possible, making it possible to obtainPatchouli Absolute.This process is however very rarely carried out because it is generally not appreciated by perfumers."

With a rich history, this ingredient is used in the composition of many perfume schemes and families such as woody, oriental and chypre fragrances (withBergamot EO,Cistus EO,Cistus Labdanum Absolute GreenandOak Moss Absolute).Initially used as an anti-mosquito during long sea crossings, the scent of patchouli conquered Europe at the beginning of the 20th century. At that time, powerful, animalic and scents with character were very popular. This was the beginning of the appetite for patchouli. Present in Chypre by Coty (1917), in Mitsouko by Guerlain (1919). Years passed and trends changed, in the middle of the 20th century, colognes and floral bouquets appeared and put patchouli in the background. The latter became associated with decadent women and prostitutes; it is a period of major decline for patchouli.In the early 60s and 70s, hippie movement took hold and, with it, patchouli came back to the forefront and even became the main ingredient of many iconic fragrances: Patchouli by Réminiscence (1970) - Aromatics Elixir by Clinique (1972) for example. This comeback would continue into the 90s with fragrances like Angel by Thierry Mugler (1992) and Yvresse by YSL (1993). Nowadays, patchouli is more discreet, it's rare to find big launches highlighting patchouli. Yet, it is still present in the perfumers' palette and is still used a lot to bring woody freshness, to give a dead-leaf, mossy effect, but also to support other woods and give them volume and tenacity. It is therefore today a  ''secondary '' material in formulas, but the main one because of its rich history and its many uses over the last two centuries. Note that some niche brands have fragrances built around patchouli, like Patchouli Impérial by Dior (2011) and Patchouli Patch by l'Artisan Parfumeur (2002)."

This is a major challenge for the quality of a patchouli culture.The characteristic smell of patchouli is due to the presence of nor-patchoulenol, which has a much more powerful smell thanpatchoulol.An adulteration of the essential oil of patchouli can be made using the essential oil of  ''false patchouli '', from the specie Pogostemon heyneanus.

As for the petitgrain bigarade,the leaves of the tree concentrate a fragrant principle that can be extracted by steam distillation.Harvest is usually done between November and May,when the foliage of the tree is the densest. The leaves are cut manually, stored in a large container and taken to the factory. There, the leaves are dried in the sun for a few hours. Then, they are put in the extractor to be hydro-distilled.Water vapor drags the fragrant molecules to a refrigerant and the essential oil is collected at the end of the process, by decantation of the water.The fruit of the lemon tree gives an essential oil by extracting the zest of the fruit under cold expression,Lemon EO."

Also, a few tens of centimetres must be left between the plants to guarantee a better quality of the essential oil and a better extraction yield. The plants need a lot of sun exposure. The culture starts when the plant blooms (the flowers are white as reflected by the name of this thyme).In cultivation, the leafy stems of thyme are mowed or hand picked to be dried for a few hours under 104 °F. In Spain, cultivation takes place from February to August.In France, this cut is made twice a year: the first one in May and the other one around September.However, it is also possible to find crops with one cut and others with three.A steam distillation under pressure for 1.5 hours allows to collect an essential oilat the refrigerant outlet by decantation of the water.The extraction yield is between 1.5 and 2.5%.Volatile solvent extraction provides an extraction yield of about 0.3%."

Truck box distillation consists in harvesting chamomile and its stem with a harvester by grinding it. The chamomile is extracted inside the harvest box, with a water vapor entry and an exit towards a coolant, where the essential oil is collected.Traditional distillation gives a warmer and herbaceous scent, as both green and volatile molecules have evaporated during the drying step.In 2018, world cultivation of Roman chamomile spread over 1000 hectares of land, for a total production of about 16 tons of essential oil."

The flowers must be treated during the same day to get a concrete, followed by an absolute. A rose that has aged for a day does not have the same smell as a rose treated on the day of the harvest.The roses are rapidly layered in a tank filled with hexane. Three successive baths allow the extraction.After removal of the exhausted flowers and evaporation of the rose hexane (recycled to extract other roses), the concrete is collected. It solidifies quickly at room temperature because it is a waxy substance. Then, it is treated with alcohol and glazed at a temperature gradient from 140 °F to 32 °F, in order to precipitate the waxes. The absolute is obtained after filtration of the waxes and evaporation of the alcohol.The essential oil is obtained by steam distillationof the flowers resulting in a fresh and lemony smell.A rose absolute can be distilled to remove the insoluble compounds."

They are placed in sacks before they are brought to the factory, where the bags are weighed. It is best to extract the fresh roses to produce the essential oil. Although, these can not all be extracted at once. Therefore, to avoid maceration problems, it is advisable to keep them fresh and protected from moisture.Every day about 200 tons of roses can be extracted, combining hydrodistillations and volatile solvent extractions.Roses are steam distilled.The rose water is collected after a few hours of distillation in a florentine vase, by decantation of the essential oil. The water corresponds to the lower phase of the vase.After the collection, a concentration of rose water allows to evaporate part of the collected water to obtain more olfactory power.The smell of rose water is more honeyed and fruity than the essential oil, which is more lemony and fresh."

The Indian sandalwood is now registered in the red list of the IUCN ( International Union for Conservation of Nature) as it is so threatened with extinction.The α and β-Santalolare present in large majority in the essential oil, which makes sandalwood the main precursor of these molecules in there natural state, today these molecules are mainly produced in laboratory. Research into the creation and production of molecules to work a sandalwood scent was intensified in the 1950s. Today there are a large number of attractive molecules.In order to grow, sandalwood parasitizes the roots of nearby plants so that they contribute to its development. One such plant isDavana EO, which often grows at the foot of sandalwood trees in India.In India, sandalwood is a symbol of protection and wish fulfilment... There is no ceremony in India without sandalwood where it symbolizes a myriad of gods. It is one of the four sacred woods (acacia- sassafras and teak)."

This concrete is then chilled in alcohol, imposing a temperature ramp from 60°C to 0°C to the mixture to precipitate the waxes. By filtration, then evaporation of the solvent, the pine absolute is obtained.Often, the resin of the wood is used to extractTurpentine EO, which has a high added value and a stronger smell.

They are then dried in the sun or in dedicated cellars. Once dry, the shells are mostly half-open and are separated from leaves and stems before extraction.The most frequent extraction to guarantee a good olfactory quality is an extraction with supercritical CO2.The berries are first cryo-crushed by spraying high pressure nitrogen over them. Then they are put in contact with carbon dioxide in its supercritical form, i.e. at over 31°C (88°F) and 73 atmospheres. After contact between the plant and the fluid, by decompression, the extract can be recovered and treated to obtain the CO2''Absolute ''.The olfactory quality of a CO2extract, whatever the plant, is incomparable.

The older the tree, the more important the harvest: a 15 year old tree can reach 20kg of fruit per year.To collect the essential oil, seeds and bark (or seeds alone) are steam distilled for about : 48h for fresh fruits (yield: 2 to 4%) or 60h for dry fruits (yield: 8 to 9%).Extraction can also be done with volatile solvents or with supercritical CO2with a yield of about 10% but a higher quality of essential oil."

Controls are made by chemical analysis to check its rate.The essential oil of star anise is generally used to isolate the naturalAnethole. The essential oil can be subjected to an ozonolysis process to remove anisaldehyde. In this operation, almost all theanetholeincluded in the essential oil is converted to anisaldehyde."

These flowers give fruits, green at first, then yellow when ripe. That is when they are collected by hand to be dried, about forty days after flowering. Several crops are grown each year because not all plants bloom at the same time.After the umbels containing the fruit are dried, they are washed, the fruits are crushed and stored in small bags of jute. The crushed dried fruits are steam distilledand their moisture content must remain below 9%. After the extraction, Eucalyptus essential oil is collected in an essencier, once decanted from the water used to extract it.Many fennel crops are biologically warranted, as the demand for organic fennel is important in developed countries. For example, all Indian cultures are organic."

Its light green flowers are grouped in loose clusters at the top of the stems. The plant does not produce a fertile seed. The reproduction is therefore vegetative: the fibrous roots of the tarragon plant are divided and replanted in small segments between February and March. The plant is cold-resistant and needs sun without too much water to finish blooming in the spring.The harvest of tarragon takes place in June and a second harvest can be made in September.The plants are cut, leaving a few centimetres of the stem above the soil. Tarragon must be subjected to a temperature close to 32 °F and the fresh leaves are stored during one to two weeks maximum, always in a cold room to avoid any deterioration. Another way to preserve the plant is to dry it. To minimize appearance changes, the recommended temperature is 104 °F. Drying the plant reduces its level of smellious compounds. Then,the plant is steam distilled.The plant has a productive life of up to three years, after that, it needs to be renewed."

Each species also has many botanical varieties, called  ''cultivars '', whose names are often only known by professionals or well-informed amateurs, except in Japan (e.g. Goko tea, used to make matcha or gyokuro tea).The notion of  ''variety '' of tea is included in the way they are treated. Depending on the process, the olfactory and gustatory impact is not the same:Black tea (or red tea) is more woody, ripe fruits, rosy, honeyed, but its smell depends on its region of culture and on the weather.Green tea has a dry fruits and cooked plant smell, pyrogenic and floral-magnolia.Oolong tea (blue tea) has a very varied aromatic range, from rosy to woody, yellow fruits-like, etc.White tea is earthy-patchouli, even minty for some, or fruity-apricot. However, it is less powerful.Yellow tea is produced in very low quantity (only in China) and has the same notes as green tea, with additional notes of hemp and linen (due to the balottins in which it is smothered).Ripe tea has notes of mushroom, undergrowth, bark, is sometimes floral-green and aromatic."

Plants are propagated by cutting and grafting. The tea plant reaches maturity after four years: this is when its crop yield is the best. The tree is pruned to human height.Cultivation is done all year round, manually and mechanically, in China, Japan, Taiwan ... for the most beautiful crus the harvest is carried out manually.. Harvesting is done in the morning or in the early afternoon, to avoid evaporation of the essential oil. Each picker (mainly women) is paid according to their harvest yield (20 kg of leaves per day maximum in the case of mature trees).The leaves are then weighed and taken to the plant to begin processing.For green tea:it is roasted at 100°C in a wok in China, and steamed in Japan. This stops the action of enzymes, to avoid oxidation of the leaves. The leaves are then rolled so that the EO is released for the infusion. They are then dried (in heated rooms, reducing their water content to 5 to 6%) sorted and packed.Oolong tea(or blue tea):It is floundered in order to soften the leaves, the oxidation process starts at this point. Sweating the leaves in open air is a critical step, it will partially define the aromatic and taste profile. The duration of this step is variable, in order to modify and refined the degree of oxidation. The leaf is then roasted, rolled and dried.Black tea:is the most oxidized (90 to 95%). As for an oolong tea, it wilts  ''50%-60% water loss '', then is rolled to break the leaf cells, which will cause an enzymatic reaction responsible for the oxidation. The oxidation can vary from one to five hours. The tea is then desiccated to stop oxidation but also to reduce the humidity level by 4 to 5%. It is then sorted and packed.White teahas very poor oxidation, being almost instantly dried.Yellow teaundergoes the same stages as green tea. It is then put in linen bundles before drying, which gives its special notes.Ripe tea(or dark tea),also called Puerh in the Chinese province of Yunnan, can be distinguished into cooked and raw Puerh. The cooked tea is transformed into black tea and then further aged in heated, damp rooms to deepen its fermentation. The raw tea is dried naturally in the open air until it has matured to a pronounced degree.To obtain the absolute, the dry leaves of the green tea are treated with hot hexaneto extract the odorous compounds and waxes. After evaporation of the solvent by distillation, the concrete is obtained, to be treated in cold alcohol, making the waxes precipitate to obtain the absolute after evaporation of the alcohol. The decoloration of the extract is done by molecular distillation, under vacuum."

This incision is usuallymade from January to May during the dry season and from May to September during the rainy season.Following the incision, the farmers come to apply an inflamed torch on the wounded surface. This step is essential otherwise the balm would not exhilarate. Then, they put rags directly on the trunk to collect the balm by absorbing all of the exsudate for a few weeks. Afterwards, the rags are collected and boiled to separate the balm from the fabrics.After the balm is collected, it is diluted in alcohol to precipitate heavy and insoluble bodies. Precipitation is favored by glazing, which means subjecting the balm-alcohol mixture to a temperature gradient of 140 °F to 32 °F to obtain the resinoid. The resinoid is obtained with an extraction yield between 60 and 70%.The Tolu resinoid can be distilled to be bleached,without a great olfactory deterioration."

In addition, the use of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers is common for tuberose cultivation. In India, the planting of the tuberose takes place from February to May depending on the regions. Also the plants are spaced by a few tens of centimetres. Often a plantation survives for one to three years.The flowers are picked by hand from July to November.They are collected in bamboo baskets and taken to the factory. There, the baskets are weighed and the flowers are extracted with volatile solvent in an extraction tank for 30 to 60 minutes.An extraction with hexanegives a concrete, after removing the flowers and evaporating the solvent. The absolute is obtained by diluting this concrete in alcohol after a glazing at 32 °F to precipitate the waxes.The overall extraction yield is between 0.12 and 0.18% for the concrete and 20% for the absolute.These low yields explain the cost of this raw material. On one hectare of land, about 5 million flowers are picked. The extraction yield is better the first two years of cultivation and deteriorates during the third year."

The Sylvester pine resin is collected by incision of the tree. This resin is actually a means of defence for the tree and is secreted as soon as an aggression is inflicted on it. The resin flows out after a voluntary incision of the tree. Then, it is filtered and steam distilled. The essential oil is separated by decantation of the water at the refrigerant outlet.The resin yield varies according to the chemotypes and the geolocation of the tree. The extraction yield of the essential oil is between 13 and 25% which explains it low cost."

Before this period,it is necessary that the flower, which grows only once a year, is pollinated to produce the famous pod which will then be extracted in order to collect the absolute.The complexity of the pollination of vanilla lies in the fact that the flower is fertile for only 1 to 2 days even if it is present on the plant for 2 or 3 months. This very short time does not allow a very effective natural pollination.

At this stage, they contains only 10% of their olfactory potential, which will develop progressively during the drying process.The pods are scalded for three minutes in a cooking pot filled with boiling water, to heat them to their heart. Then, they are put to rest for 24 hours under a blanket after what they become black and shiny. The pods are spread on a plate and left to dry in the sun for two weeks. During this step, they are turned over once a day. Exposing them to the sun can kill bacterias and fungis that may have developed on the surface of the pod. Too much exposure would cause a degradation of the perfume.The pods are sorted by hand according to their size and drying degree.It's a very long step, as the sorting must be done rigorously.The full aromatic potential of vanilla develops fully after a year and a half.The extraction of the vanilla absolute is done through 3 consecutive extractions withEthanol.Each of these extractions can last up to 5 days. This extraction gives a concrete once the 3 fractions are gathered together and the solvent is removed. This concrete contains waxes, insoluble in alcohol. Waxes are separated from the fragrant principle by a glazing process in alcohol and the absolute is collected after evaporation of the glazing alcohol.This absolute will then continue to improve over timeand will be considered optimal after a 6 months maceration.Note that it is also possible to obtain an oleoresin and a CO2extract of vanilla."

Its physical characteristics make vetiver particularly resistant to all climatic conditions, although it prefers a tropical or subtropical climate coupled with sandy and calcareous soil, which is conducive to root development.Its harvest, whose period depends on the place of culture (from December to September for Haiti, from June to November for the bourbon vetiver), comes after about 1 year of culture, an optimal moment combining yield and quality.Harvest & extraction process are complex and are defined in several stages:1 - The leaves (aerial part) are clipped together to delimit the plants before the cut.2 - The plants are unearthed and divided into 3 parts: The leaves (used for local handcrafts) - The stump (space between the leaves and the roots. This will be replanted immediately for the next crops) - The roots (grouped together for the next steps of the process)3 - The roots (underground part) are then shaken and washed to remove the soil. Then, they are gathered in a bale to be taken to the factory. Washing is an important step. It avoids distilling soil, leaves or debris that could decrease the essential oil quality. This washing is done by shaking the roots and/or by introducing them into a sort of drum (like a dry washing machine) which will, thanks to its successive rotations, separate the debris/earth from the roots.4- The root is dried for 2 to 3 days and then water-distilled.The distillation lasts about ten hours. The essence is then recovered in a decanter.5 - At the end of the distillation process, 3 phases are formed in the decanter. The phase located at the top is the vetiver EO. Below is the water of distillation and then, still below, the heavy fraction of the EO. The latter contains the heaviest components with an earthy, smoky smell. Usually the two phases of EO are grouped together, but sometimes they are not, it usually depends of the customer's request, depending on the olfactory finesse and price searched for. It also happens that a centrifugation step is necessary to release water bubbles trapped in the EO.The yield is 1% on average(with a better yield for theVetiver Java EO). For Vetiver Bourbon EO, after 5 hours, the light fraction is recovered and separated from the water by decantation, then the heavy fraction is recovered on sheep's wool, which is impregnated with it.Note that the younger the root, the better the extraction yield, but the quality of the essential oil is then less good.The root is also extractable with volatile solvents, to obtain an absolute,much less used in perfumery. On the other hand, it is very common to carry out fractional distillation from Haiti Vetiver HE. These additional distillations are generally carried out by the formulating companies in order to obtain very precise products such as Vetiver Heart, Vetiver MD,Vetiveryl Acetateetc..."

Vetiver business is nevertheless surviving, and is best loved by perfumers.Vetiveryl Acetateand Vetiverol, often of natural origin, can be obtained from the essential oil.

                "info": "Vetiver is a plant that can grow up to 2m high. It has long leaves and also very long roots. The massive cultivation of this plant is due to the roots. Its physical characteristics make vetiver particularly resistant to all climatic conditions, although it prefers a tropical or subtropical climate coupled with sandy and calcareous soil, which is conducive to root development.Its harvest, whose period depends on the place of culture (from December to September for Haiti, from June to November for the bourbon vetiver), comes after about 1 year of culture, an optimal moment combining yield and quality.Harvest & extraction process are complex and are defined in several stages:1 - The leaves (aerial part) are clipped together to delimit the plants before the cut.2 - The plants are unearthed and divided into 3 parts: The leaves (used for local handcrafts) - The stump (space between the leaves and the roots. This will be replanted immediately for the next crops) - The roots (grouped together for the next steps of the process)3 - The roots (underground part) are then shaken and washed to remove the soil. Then, they are gathered in a bale to be taken to the factory. Washing is an important step. It avoids distilling soil, leaves or debris that could decrease the essential oil quality. This washing is done by shaking the roots and/or by introducing them into a sort of drum (like a dry washing machine) which will, thanks to its successive rotations, separate the debris/earth from the roots.4- The root is dried for 2 to 3 days and then water-distilled.The distillation lasts about ten hours. The essence is then recovered in a decanter.5 - At the end of the distillation process, 3 phases are formed in the decanter. The phase located at the top is the vetiver EO. Below is the water of distillation and then, still below, the heavy fraction of the EO. The latter contains the heaviest components with an earthy, smoky smell. Usually the two phases of EO are grouped together, but sometimes they are not, it usually depends of the customer's request, depending on the olfactory finesse and price searched for. It also happens that a centrifugation step is necessary to release water bubbles trapped in the EO.The yield is 1% on average(with a better yield for the Vetiver Java EO). For Vetiver Bourbon EO, after 5 hours, the light fraction is recovered and separated from the water by decantation, then the heavy fraction is recovered on sheep's wool, which is impregnated with it.Note that the younger the root, the better the extraction yield, but the quality of the essential oil is then less good.The root is also extractable with volatile solvents,to obtain an absolute, much less used in perfumery."

An hectare of cultivation allows to cultivate 10 tons of leaves per cut (the number of cuts each year varies from 1 to 4 according to the place of harvest). The leaves are gathered in large bags and taken to the extraction plant.The fresh leaves are placed into the extractor immediately or after a day,and extracted with a first volatile solvent such as hexane, to obtain the violet leaf concrete, in the form of a dark green paste, after evaporation of the solvent.To obtain the concrete, two extractions with hexane of two hours each, are necessary.The extraction yield for the concrete is about 0.09%.Once the concrete with hexane is obtained, it is diluted in alcohol to precipitate the waxes by glazing at 32 °F. The absolute is obtained after filtration and evaporation of the alcohol. Sometimes, the violet leaf extraction result is subject to a distillation to be bleached, without a great olfactory impact."

Also, a few tens of centimetres must be left between the plants to guarantee a better quality of the essential oil and a better extraction yield. The plants need a lot of sun exposure. The culture starts when the plant blooms (the flowers are white as reflected by the name of this thyme).In cultivation, the leafy stems of thyme are mowed or hand picked to be dried for a few hours under 104 °F. In Spain, cultivation takes place from February to August.A steam distillation under pressure allows to collect an essential oilat the refrigerant outlet, by decantation of the water.A volatile solvent extraction gives an absolute of white thyme, which is very little used."

                "info": "The Canaga odorata is a tree that can measure 20 to 30 meters in height. To facilitate the harvest of the flowers, the trees are topped at two meters height throughout their life. In addition, each branch, called  ''epicormic shoot '', is cut to stress the tree so it produces a maximum of flowers to ensure the sustainability of it specie. The branches fall back to the ground, and flowers are found under the leaves. Green at first, then yellow when ripe.The ylang-ylang flower is cultivated all year long in a tropical or sub-tropical climate (flowering is more abundant from November to April). At maturity, the base of the flowers turns red. The harvest is done in the morning, from 5am to 8am, to prevent the evaporation of the aromatic molecules of the flower during the day. The harvest is done manually by women and the flowers are collected in baskets (5 kg of flowers per hour, knowing that a flower weighs no more than two grams!) and weighed at the factory.During the same day,the flowers are subjected to a steam distillation.This means that the most volatile molecules are collected in the very first fraction called  ''Extra '', followed by fraction I, II and III. The flower can also be totally distilled in a single fraction, called  ''complete essential oil ''.The extraction of ylang-ylang often turns around 2%,regardless of its fractionation. An adult tree can produce 10 to 20 kg of flowers per year.It is finally possible to extract the flowers with a volatile solvent, to obtain a concrete and an absolute.No fractionation is possible with this process.Ylang-ylang essential oils can be rectified by distillation to remove insoluble compounds."
